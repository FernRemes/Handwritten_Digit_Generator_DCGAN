# Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network Digit Generator Model

Observe how well a program is able to generate a number from a previous iteration or image using DCGAN and predict the number trying to generate. In this program I set the number the number of eopchs or iterations to 100, and each epoch took minutes to generate. Thus if you want to try this program either be patient, reduce the amount of iterations, or pray your gpu or cpu is powerful enough to generate an image quickly. 

## Result
